1. State a clear prediction question, not just what you did. Asking clear questions is the key to getting clear answers. You don't need to pick a "client", but sometimes it's helpful to think about the hypothetical scenario in which, say, NOAA or FEMA or a hospital would use your model.

Prediction Questions: (taken from EDA- are we using these?)
- How will agricultural emissions change in the future?
- In what countries will emissions change the most?

2. Organize your discussion around two or three key tables or plots or numbers. Don't write up everything you did: Focus on your main result, and then add exposition around it until the reader is able to appreciate what you did and why. This keeps your writing from becoming bloated and rambling: Work backwards from the result to the reader's initial conditions.


*one key finding- not 100% sure on this

(Boxplot of GDP by Emission Quantiles)
The following boxplot displays the distribution of GDP values over different emission quantiles. The first two quantiles represent the lowest emissions, both with a relaitvely low median GDP, and a large amount of outliers. The last quantile representing the highest emission levels also has a comparatively low median GDP, with a lot less outliers. Overall, these results show a lower range of GDP values for countries with the top emissions, indicating that the highest emitters are likely to be countries with lower GDP. Although this finding supports the notion that the highest levels of emissions are more likely to be from countries with lower GDP, we have to take into account other factors that may be contributing to this.
