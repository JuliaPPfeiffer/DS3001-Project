Research Question: What are the emission levels over time per country? What model provides the most accurate predictions of emission levels? 

1. What is an observation in your study?

Observations in our study are a country's data on multiple environmental measures for one specific year (ranging from 1990 to 2020). 

2. Are you doing supervised or unsupervised learning? Classification or regression?

Since our goal is to predict emissions levels over time per country, we will be conducting a regression by comparing the performance of various linear regression models (supervised learning). After producing our models, we will be able to compare the predictions of emission levels per country to the true values from the original dataset. 

3. How will you prepare the data specifically for your analysis? What models or algorithms do you plan to use in your analysis? How? - Eva

4. How will you know if your approach "works"? What does success mean? - Larissa

5. What are weaknesses that you anticipate being an issue? How will you deal with them if they come up? If your approach fails, what might you learn from this unfortunate outcome?

6. How will you communicate or present your results?
