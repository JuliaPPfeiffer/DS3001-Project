1. What is in your data?

2. How will these data be useful for studying the phenomenon you're interested in?

3. What are the challenges you've resolved or expect to face in using them?

One challenge we anticipate facing during our project is combining the two datasets that we have chosen to analyze. 
We chose a dataset on agricultural CO2 emissions as well as a dataset on GDP per capita. Each dataset contains data from the 
last few decades for different geographical areas. We will join these datasets together by geographical area, however, the 
two datasets have variation in naming for this variable. For example, the agrofood dataset contains data for “Anguilla” while 
the GDP dataset does not. The GDP dataset has a broader range of categories with values such as “Pacific island small states,” 
“Pre-demographic dividend,” or “OECD members” that are not in the agrofood dataset. Additionally, the agrofood dataset contains data
from 1990-2020 while the GDP dataset begins in 1960. These variations will likely cause more effort to be put into the data cleaning
process when combining the datasets, and we will have to leave out certain geographical areas from the GDP dataset. Although the 
GDP dataset contains more geographical areas, it also contains a large amount of missing data. Because of this, we may not be 
able to find significant relationships between certain variables or make accurate predictions for geographical areas/years with 
too much missing data.
